 As someone who is new to coding and doesn't know much about CLI and GUI, I find it fascinating to explore the differences between these two interfaces. The primary distinction between them lies in how users interact with a computer system. CLI, or Command-Line Interface, is a text-based interface where users give direct instructions (commands) to the computer system by typing lines of text. These commands can perform various operations such as creating, editing, or deleting files, managing directories and more. Since there is no graphical representation involved, it may not be as intuitive for newcomers. However, it can prove faster and more efficient for those who master it, mainly due to its ability to receive and execute complex tasks through simple text commands. GUI, or (Graphical User Interface) is an interface that relies on graphics, icons, and visual elements for user interaction. It enables individuals to interact with a computer by using windows, buttons, menus, icons and similar visual elements on screen. With GUIs, users don't need to memorize different commands as they can navigate using their mouse or touchscreen. This makes GUIs more user-friendly and accessible for beginners as they can easily perform tasks without knowing technical commands.
