For my final project, I want to create a musical scene. This project will build on the skills and techniques we've learned throughout the course. I am particularly interested in exploring how far I can go with this project so that it is uniquely me and creative.  

Inspiration and Influence: 

 I'm inspired by the past example “Fireflies” by Lindsey Sewell. I am drawn to the way it looks and want to incorporate similar ideas into my project. 

  

Challenges and Learning Goals: 

 I know that I will need to learn more about how to code this. I'm excited to dive deeper into synchronicity coding. I am also aware that I will need to solve problems related to bugs and technical issues. 

Work Plan: 

 To complete my project on time, I will need to follow this rough schedule: 

 Week 1: Complete Final sketch of project and start working on it 

Week 2: Continue working on my project and hopefully complete it 

Week 3: Finish up project and fix any mistakes. Also make changes if needed. 

 

Progress This Week: 

So far this week I have brainstormed ideas for what I want my project to look like. I've made progress on deciding that I want to create some sort of musical scene, but I still need to figure out exact details.
